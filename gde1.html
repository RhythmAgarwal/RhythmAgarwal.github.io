					<h4>Research Questions</h4>
					<p>To understand the problem better I wanted answers to a few questions - </p>

					<p>• Why are there millions of animals in shelters?<br> • What problems do adopters face in finding their match?<br> • What are adopters looking for in a right companion?<br> • What are the consequences of not finding a right companion?<br>
					</p>
					<h4>Finding Answers</h4>
					<p>To scope down the exercise, I focused on dog adoption.</p>
					<p><b>Secondary Research</b><br> To find the answers to this questions I did some secondary research and looked around for current solutions like Pet Finder and adoption shelter websites. Also looked at analogous domains like dating apps.
						<br><br><b>Dog Hike</b><br> I went on a dog hike with bunch (8-10) of adopters to talk to them and understand their relationship with their dogs and their journey of finding their companion.
						<br><br><b>Shelter Visit</b><br> I put myself in the shoes of an adopter and went to my nearby animal shelter looking to adopt a pet.

					<h5>1. While adopting from shelters or adoption events, lifestyle questions are asked much later in the process for approving a choice rather than making a match. </h5>
					<p>Since lifestyle approval is done in the end when adopter already has their heart set on a pet, there disappointments and compromises. And none of the current aggregator apps are asking lifestyle questions to find pet options. There is also lack of
						trust in quizzes that find adopter their match.</p>
					<br>
					<h5>2. Currently, the only way to understand pet’s behavior and temperament is to go down to the shelter or adoption events and talk to pet’s caretaker which is time consuming. </h5>
					<p>Choosing a pet as a companion is an emotional decision highly driven by pet’s appearance and behaviors. People believe the most in caretaker’s assessment of pet’s behavior. It is time consuming and repetitive for both adopter and caretakers to talk
						about pet’s behavior to each individual.</p>
					<br>
					<h5>3. Pets come and go at a shelter, events happen nearby for adoption  and people do not get to know if they have missed a good match if they are not actively looking. </h5>
					<p>Adopters are making all the efforts to come across and meet their potential meets, there are no updates or pull from the shelters once adopters have left the shelters or the adoption events.</p>

				3. Once we know about the lifestyle and preferences of an adopter we can nudge potential adopters whenever there’s a good match near them so that they don’t miss any chance of being with their perfect companion.</h5>

Being transparent is the key so that people set the right expectations. They can ask more specific questions to the shelter/foster/individuals here.
Once people are interested and confident about compatibility, they are provided with shelter information so they can schedule a visit or walk-in to the shelter to look at their pet. Because there is nothing like looking at a pet in person.

					<p>I looped back with people I talked to for research for their feedback. Things people liked- </p>
					<h5>People loved Live Videos.</h5>
					<p>“I like that in a live video with their caretaker I can see the dog in a more social and friendly environment. This brings out more of their personality and behavior compared to high stress environments in shelter kennels and adoption events.”
					</p>
					<h5>People liked getting nudges about matches and event</h5>
					<p>“Currently, information is scattered, it’s hard to find things until you are looking and you have to know where to look for. This is brings the information to you which will save time and effort”
					</p>
					<h5>People liked the temperament and behavior keywords used to describe pets.</h5>
					<p>“When describing the pet I want open-endedly, I am not sure if what I said was interpreted correctly so picking from a list helps. Usually, there is a paragraph written and I don’t get the gist of it. Keywords along with description makes me more
						confident and trust the traits of the dog.”
					</p><br><br>
					<p>Suggestions from users-</p>

					<p>“Ranking the traits by most important to least important might help in further sorting”
						<br>
						<br>“Ability to change the lifestyle answers later will be helpful if the conditions of living changes etc.”
						<br>
						<br>“If I am really interested in a dog, I can probably ask them to hold it for me?”
						<br>
						<br>“It would also help to know stuff post adoption, tips on how to take care in the beginning for a new adopter”</p>
