							<h1>Problem</h1>
							<h4>LinkedIn enables professionals to be more productive and successful by helping them stay informed and build meaningful relationships. A productive content ecosystem relies on a healthy balance of content contributors and consumers that share and learn knowledge about their industries, careers and professional interests.

<br><br>For many members, however, it feels scary or risky to contribute to the platform since their actions are tied to their professional identities.

					<h4>Research Questions</h4>
					<p>To understand the problem better I wanted answers to a few questions - </p>

					<p>• Why are users not sharing on LinkedIn?<br> • What are the barriers faced by users when sharing on LinkedIn?<br> • Why motivates users to share on their professional network?<br> • What are their fears?<br>
					</p>
					<h4>Finding Answers</h4>
					<p>• To get answers to the above questions I talked to 9 friends in my network who are on LinkedIn as professionals.
						<br>• To validate what I was hearing and to to get the most prominent pain points and motivations I sent out a <a href = "https://goo.gl/forms/B6lIUnXElVd9vjlF2" target="_blank">survey</a> (which received 42 responses). This helped me scope down.
						<br>• I also read a lot on LinkedIn Help about sharing and articles by a few LinkedIn employees on sharing, their stories and tips.
