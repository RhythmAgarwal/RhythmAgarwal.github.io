                <p>The number of cancer cases in a year in India is huge and are increasing.
                  Palliative care or end of life care in India is in a relatively early stage
                  of development and consequently faces numerous problems.
                  There is ample scope and need of development in this area.
                  Goal of this project was to design an Information and Communication
                   Technology based solution providing efﬁcient delivery of palliative care.<br><br>

                  <p>Befriend is a framework for a system which focuses on the efficient delivery of Palliative Care to cancer patients right from the diagnosis of Cancer by use of Information and Communication Technology. Facilitating a holistic approach to treatment through palliative care, giving special emphasis to the psychological, social and spiritual needs of the suffering.

              </div><br><h4>Contextual Inquiry</h4>
                    <p>Contextual Interviews, one of the qualitative research methods, are optimal for collecting data on individuals’ personal histories, perspectives, and experiences. Considering cancer to be a sensitive topic and to understand it from the perspectives of the local population it involves we adopted this method to take our research forward.
                      <br><img src="img/befriend/interview.jpg" class="img-responsive">
                      <br></p>

                <h4>Data Analysis and Insights</h4><p>The interviews were then closely analyzed based on a
                      shared understanding. The data was then consolidated using Affinity Diagram.
                       The affinity helped us summarize the insights, make them manageable,
                       presentable and facilitates discussion leading to newer insights.
                       <img src="img/befriend/analysis.jpg" class="img-responsive"><br><br>
                    </p>
                    <h4>Identifying gaps and Proposing framework</h4><p>There seemed to be a visible lack of communication gap in the system.
                      There was a need for the patient to communicate better with all involved in the
                      treatment especially family, doctors and psychologists was not being
                      fulfilled. We saw a vision to facilitate better communication and community participation.
                     <img src="img/befriend/framework.jpg" class="img-responsive"><br><br></p>

                      <h4>Defining system stakeholders</h4><p>The system consists of patients(primary users),
                        along with befriend team which includes supporters and survivors network,
                        our doctors, researchers and psychologists who work as counsellors.
                        This whole system has three aspects to cover - the social aspect,
                        the well-being aspect(physical and psychological) and the awareness aspect of the patient.

                     <h4>Use Case Scenarios</h4>
                   <p><img src="img/befriend/usecase.png" class="img-responsive"><br><br></p>

                       <h4>High Fidelity Prototype</h4><p> The prototype was built to have speciﬁc features
                          working for testing. It was built using Axure and it
                          was made working on a Asus 10’ android tablet.

                      <img src="img/befriend/testscr.jpg" class="img-responsive"><br><br></p>

                      <h4>Usability Testing</h4><p> An application fails due to a number of
                        reasons relating to accessibility, purpose, usability and appearance,
                        the foremost being usability. Therefore, it is as necessary to take the
                        application through usability testing as it is to develop it. Testing
                        involved 5 participants who self-defined themselves as Cancer patients.
                         Testing was task based i.e. there was a sequence of specified tasks
                         given to the participants to be performed by them without any help
                         from the observers (besides indirect prompts at times).
